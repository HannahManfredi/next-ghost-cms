Welcome to Rabbit Rabbit: Emotional Software Engineering, my static (SSG) blog (I built the frontend with Next.js and ghost, a headless CMS).

Step 1 Use the Ghost CMS interface to edit and publish the posts and pages of my blog.


Step 2 Use Next.js to fetch the posts and pages through the Ghost API, create the routing for them and compose the final layout with React components and Tailwind + vanilla css styling.


Step 3 Next.js will build and export my static generated site (SSG) for further usage.


Step 4 Deploy the generated website to github pages!
